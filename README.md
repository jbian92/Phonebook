# Phonebook
This phonebook was created during Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 5. It uses Bash scripting.

## Features
```
./phonebook.sh new <first name> <last name> <number>   # adds an entry to the phonebook
./phonebook.sh list                                    # displays every entry in the phonebook
./phonebook.sh clear                                   # deletes the entire phonebook 
./phonebook.sh remove <first name> <last name>         # deletes all entries associated with that name
./phonebook.sh lookup <first name> <last name>         # displays all phone numbers associated with that name
```
